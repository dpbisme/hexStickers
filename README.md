# hexStickers
This Repository holds code, images and instructions for creating hex stickers for DIYtranscriptomics course and MicrobiomeDB.org

Sticker deigns are created by running the hexSticker.R script.  These designs are then directly used for ordering stickers from StickerMule [here](https://www.stickermule.com/uses/hexagon-stickers)
